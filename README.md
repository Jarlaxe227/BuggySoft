# BuggySoft
A program we had to write bug reports for in school, that I wish to remake to actually be useful.

It initially was a tenant program that was written in C to maintain tenant information (name, phone number, apt#, etc.)
The program was littered with bugs. So, as an excercise for myself, I decided to remake it with repairs.

We were only given an executable file, so all of my code will be mine unless otherwise mentioned in comments.
